 - The navbar has a dark gray background color and is fixed at the top of the screen.
 - The links within the navbar are displayed as inline-block elements and have a gold-colored line at the bottom.
 - The active link has a green background color.
 - When hovering over a link, it changes to a light gray background color and the gold-colored line becomes brighter.
 - The links have rounded borders and a shadow effect.

Feel free to customize the CSS styles in the style.css file to match the design of your website.


You can use this navbar as a starting point for your own website or integrate it into an existing project. Enjoy building your navigation bar with this simple and stylish implementation!

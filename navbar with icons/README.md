# Navbar with Icons

This is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code snippet that demonstrates the implementation of a navbar with icons. The navbar is fixed at the top of the page and contains a list of links with corresponding icons.

## HTML Structure

The HTML structure consists of a `<nav>` element with an unordered list (`<ul>`) inside. Each list item (`<li>`) contains an anchor (`<a>`) element representing a link, and a `<span>` element with the class "icon" that displays an icon.

## CSS Styling

The CSS styles define the appearance of the navbar and its components. The navigation bar has a light gray background color, a box shadow, and is fixed at the top of the page. The links are displayed as a flex container with centered alignment. The icons are vertically centered and have a transition effect when hovered.

## JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript code provides additional functionality to the navbar. It includes the following functions:

- `toggleMobileMenu()`: This function toggles the mobile menu by adding or removing the "open" class from the menu.
- `highlightCurrentPageLink()`: This function highlights the current page link by adding the "active" class to the corresponding link.
- `scrollToSection(event)`: This function scrolls to a specific section when a link is clicked.

These functions enhance the user experience and provide interactive features to the navbar.

## How to Use

To use this code snippet, follow these steps:

1. Create an HTML file and copy the HTML code into the `<body>` section.
2. Create a CSS file and copy the CSS code into it.
3. Create a JavaScript file and copy the JavaScript code into it.
4. Link the CSS file and JavaScript file to the HTML file using `<link>` and `<script>` tags.
5. Customize the icons, link text, and add any additional styling as needed.

Once the files are linked and customized, you can open the HTML file in a web browser to see the navbar with icons in action.

Note: Make sure to include the appropriate icons or replace them with your desired icons. You can use Unicode characters or font icons to represent the icons.

Enjoy using the navbar with icons in your web projects!

# Radio Bar

This is a simple HTML and CSS code snippet that showcases the implementation of a radio bar with tabs. The radio bar allows users to switch between different tab options by selecting the corresponding radio button.

## HTML Structure

The HTML structure consists of a container `<div>` that holds the entire radio bar. Within the container, there is a `<div>` element with the class "radio-bar" that represents the radio bar itself. Inside the radio bar, there are radio input elements (`<input type="radio">`) and labels (`<label>`) for each tab option. Additionally, there is a glider element (`<span class="glider">`) that slides over to indicate the selected tab.

## CSS Styling

The CSS styles define the appearance and behavior of the radio bar and its components. It includes styling for the selected radio button, the notification within the selected label, and the glider element based on the selected tab. The radio bar container is styled with a gradient background, rounded corners, and a box shadow. The labels and glider element have transitions and hover effects to enhance interactivity.

## How to Use

To use this code snippet, follow these steps:

1. Create an HTML file and copy the HTML code into the `<body>` section.
2. Create a CSS file and copy the CSS code into it.
3. Link the CSS file to the HTML file using the `<link>` tag.
4. Customize the styles and content as needed, such as changing the tab labels and colors.
5. Open the HTML file in a web browser to see the radio bar in action.

Note: Make sure to link the CSS file correctly and adjust the styles to match your desired design.

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of the radio bar, including:

- Modifying the tab labels: Replace the text within the `<label>` elements to represent your desired tab names.
- Changing the colors: Adjust the color values in the CSS to match your preferred color scheme.
- Adding more tabs: Duplicate the radio input and label elements, and adjust the CSS styles accordingly.
- Modifying the glider animation: Adjust the translation values in the CSS to change the glider's position when different tabs are selected.

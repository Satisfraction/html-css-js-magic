This code provides a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation for selecting an image file and displaying it on a web page.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure that you have the following:

- An image file (e.g., `img.png`) to display
- A CSS file (e.g., `style.css`) for styling the web page
- A JavaScript file (e.g., `script.js`) for handling the image selection functionality

## Getting Started

To use this code, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Place the `img.png` file in the same directory as the HTML file.
3. Customize the CSS in the `style.css` file to suit your preferences.
4. Modify the JavaScript in the `script.js` file if necessary.

## Usage

To run the code, open the HTML file (`index.html`) in a web browser. You should see a web page with an empty image placeholder and a file input field.

1. Click on the file input field to select an image file from your device.
2. After selecting an image file, the selected image will be displayed in the image placeholder.

## CSS Styling

The CSS file (`style.css`) contains styles for the web page, including the background color, image size, border radius, and object fit. You can modify the CSS to customize the appearance of the page.

## JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript file (`script.js`) handles the image selection functionality. When an image file is selected using the file input field, the selected image is displayed in the image placeholder.
